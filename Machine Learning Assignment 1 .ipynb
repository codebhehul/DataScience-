    "1. Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence encompasses the development of computer systems capable of executing tasks that typically necessitate human intelligence. These tasks span learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI can be broadly categorized into two types: Narrow AI (or Weak AI), designed for specific tasks, and General AI (or Strong AI), aiming to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across diverse domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A classic illustration of AI is the virtual personal assistant, such as Siri or Google Assistant. These systems utilize natural language processing and machine learning to comprehend user queries, offer pertinent information, and execute tasks like setting reminders or sending messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence, revolves around crafting algorithms and models enabling computers to learn from data. Instead of explicit programming for a task, a machine learning model discerns patterns and makes predictions or decisions based on new data. ML is broadly categorized into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Picture a spam email filter. In a supervised learning scenario, the model trains on a dataset containing spam and non-spam emails. The algorithm learns data patterns, enabling it to classify new emails as spam or non-spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning, within the machine learning realm, employs artificial neural networks to model and solve intricate problems. These networks comprise layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) processing and transforming input data. Particularly adept at handling large amounts of unstructured data like images, audio, and text, deep learning has found applications in various domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Think of image recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This involves training a CNN to recognize objects in images. With increased data processing, the network autonomously learns hierarchical features, achieving high accuracy in identifying objects. This technology finds wide use in facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical image analysis applications.\n"
