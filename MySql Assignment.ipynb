    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for easy retrieval and manipulation. Databases are essential for storing and managing vast amounts of information in a structured manner efficient to access, update, and query the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Database:\n",
    "1. SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined schema and relationships.\n",
    "2. They use SQL to perform operations like creating, updating, querying, and deleting data.\n",
    "3. Data integrity and consistency are ensured through ACID properties.\n",
    "4. Suitable for applications with well-defined and structured data requirements, such as financial systems, CRM, and e-commerce.\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Database:\n",
    "1. NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in a more flexible and schema-less manner.\n",
    "2. They use various data models like document-based, key-value, column-family, and graph databases.\n",
    "3. Designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, making them scalable and suitable for modern web applications, social networks, and big data applications.\n",
    "4. Sacrifices some ACID properties in favor of CAP theorem.\n",
    "Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase, etc."

    "# Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies each record (row) in a table. It ensures the uniqueness and integrity of the data in the table. Each table in a database can have only one primary key.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables and ensures referential integrity. It helps maintain consistency and prevents orphaned records.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "CREATE TABLE departments (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
