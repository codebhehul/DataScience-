    "1. Install Bokeh: Ensure that have Bokeh installed in Python environment.\n",
    "2. Import Bokeh: Import the necessary modules and functions from Bokeh.\n",
    "3. Create Data: Prepare the data want to visualize. This can be done using Python data structures like lists or NumPy arrays.\n",
    "4. Create a Figure: Create a Bokeh figure using the figure function.\n",
    "5. Add Glyphs: Add glyphs (visual shapes) to the figure to display your data. Common glyphs include circles, lines, and bars.\n",
    "6. Customize Appearance: Customize the appearance of the plot by setting attributes for the figure, axes, title, and legend.\n",
    "7. Output the Plot: Specify where to display the plot, either in a standalone HTML file or in a Jupyter Notebook cell.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Bokeh, glyphs are the visual shapes or markers used to represent data points in a plot. Glyphs are a fundamental concept in Bokeh, and they can be used to create a wide variety of charts and visualizations. Bokeh provides a range of glyph types, including circles, squares, lines, bars, patches, and more, each of which can be customized to represent data in different ways.\n",

    "Add glyphs: To add glyphs to the plot, you can use specific glyph functions like circle, square, line, etc., to create the desired shapes. These glyph functions take data as arguments to determine the positions and attributes of the glyphs.\n",

    "# Q4. What is a Bokeh server, and how can you use it to create interactive plots that can be updated in real time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bokeh Server is a component of the Bokeh plotting library that allows to create interactive web applications with real-time updates. It extends Bokeh's capabilities by enabling the creation of dynamic, interactive plots where the data can be updated on the server side, and the changes are reflected in the client's browser in real-time. This is particularly useful for creating dashboards, live data visualizations, or applications that require frequent updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. Session:\n",
    "    .A Bokeh Server session is established when a user connects to a Bokeh application.\n",
    "    .Multiple users can have independent sessions with the server.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Documents:\n",
    "    .A Bokeh Document represents the state of a Bokeh application.\n",
    "    .Changes to the document trigger updates in the connected clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Callbacks:\n",
    "   .Callbacks are Python functions that are executed in response to user interactions or changes in data.\n",
    "   .They can update the Bokeh Document, allowing for dynamic, real-time updates.\n",
    "   \n",
    " How to Use Bokeh Server for Real-time Updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Bokeh Server:\n",
    "    .pip install bokeh\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Create a Bokeh App:\n",
    "   .Define your interactive plot and any necessary callbacks in a Python script.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Run the Bokeh Server:\n",
    "    .bokeh serve your_app_script.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Access the App:\n",
    "   .Open a web browser and go to the specified address (usually http://localhost:5006/your_app_script).\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Updating in Real-Time:\n",
    "   .Use callbacks to define how the plot should update based on user interactions or changing data.\n",
    "   .Bokeh Server handles the communication between the server and connected clients."
